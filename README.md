###LIRI-BOT###

*** Description ***
Liri-Bot is a Node-device that lets users search song, movie, and concert data using Spotify, OMDB, and BandsInTown APIs.

*** How it Works ***
Users type "spotify-this" to retrieve song info, "movie-this" for movie data, and "concert-this" for an artist's upcoming shows.

*** Motivation ***
This application is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program in which students can utilize their API retrieval abilities using Node AXIOS.

*** Result ***
The result is an easy-to-use application that lets users look up song, movie, and concert information.

*** Improvements ****
I would like to integrate voice-control for liri-bot. In other words, I have more learning to do!
